###Fake News Detection with PassiveAggressiveClassifier
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to detect fake news. The notebook provides a comprehensive workflow for preprocessing data, training classifiers, and evaluating their performance.

Overview
The objective of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately classify news articles as real or fake. The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and performance evaluation.

Features
Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load and preprocess a dataset of news articles, including cleaning and tokenizing text data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform initial analysis to understand the structure and content of the dataset.
Feature Extraction: Use techniques like CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer to transform text data into numerical features.
Model Training: Train various classifiers, including PassiveAggressiveClassifier and RandomForestClassifier.
Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and F1 score.
Visualization: Visualize the results using plots and word clouds.
Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

title: The title of the news article.
text: The full text of the news article.
label: The label indicating whether the article is real or fake.


Results
The notebook will generate the following outputs:

Accuracy scores for each classifier.
Confusion matrices and classification reports.
Visualizations of word clouds for fake and real news articles.
Dependencies
